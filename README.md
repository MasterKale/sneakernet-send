# Project Fig Bar

What might an E2EE message protection system, backed by WebAuthn + `prf` extension, look like if it
were user-friendly?

Inspired by my own work here:

https://blog.millerti.me/2023/01/22/encrypting-data-in-the-browser-using-webauthn/

## Objectives

- Easy to use
- Entirely client-side
- Sufficiently strong protection

## Requirements

- `python3 -m http.server`
  - Or whatever you want to use to host it locally, doesn't matter so long as it's available locally at http://localhost:8000 (other ports are fine too)

## Demo

TBD
